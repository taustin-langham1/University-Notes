# Notes
**The Primary Focus On Notes Should Be Around Answering These Types Of Questions**

Number of clusters is represented by K

K-means groups similar points into clusters
**Centroid based**
i) 

point for customers:

1 = (200, 5)
2 = (450, 8)
3 = (150, 3)
4 = (500, 10)
5 = (300, 6)

EUCLIDIAN DISTACNCE = _/(x1 - a1) + (y1 - b1)
DISTANCE TO CENTROID 1 = DISTANCE FROM CUSTOMER 1 = DISTANCE FROM (200, 5)

CUSTOMER 1 = 0
CUSTOMER 2 = 250
CUSTOMER 3 = 50
CUSTOMER 4 = 300
CUSTOMER 5 = 100

DISTANCE TO CENTROID 2= DISTANCE FROM CUSTOMER 2 = DISTANCE FROM (500, 10)

CUSTOMER 1 = 300
CUSTOMER 2 = 50
CUSTOMER 3 = 350
CUSTOMER 4 = 0
CUSTOMER 5 = 200

WHICH IS THE LOWER DISTANCE TO WHICH CENTROID FOR EACH CUSTOMER

ASSIGNED CLUSER

CUSTOMER 1 = C1
CUSTOMER 2 = C2
CUSTOMER 3 = C1
CUSTOMER 4 = C2
CUSTOMER 5 = C1


ii) RECALCULATE NEW CENTROIDS AFTER THE FIRST CALCULATION

NEW CENTROID FOR C1 =
X = AVERAGE ALL THE X's OF ALL X's IN CENTROID 1
Y = AVERAGE ALL THE Y's OF ALL Y's IN CENTROID 1

NEW CENTROID FOR C2 =
X = AVERAGE ALL THE X's OF ALL X's IN CENTROID 2
Y = AVERAGE ALL THE Y's OF ALL Y's IN CENTROID 2


# Slide Notes
**Primary focus on just trivia**

Clustering is the process of dividing the datasets into groups, consisting
of similar data points
➢ Points in the same group are as similar as possible
➢ Points in different group are as dissimilar as possible
