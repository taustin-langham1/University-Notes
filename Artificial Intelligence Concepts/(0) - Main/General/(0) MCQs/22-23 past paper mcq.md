Name and explain three reasons that classic machine learning algorithms, such as 𝑘-
nearest neighbor might struggle to learn from data

the more dimensions there are, the distance between features becomes less meaningful.

sensitive to noise and outliers

unsalable and a great computational cost for large datasets
