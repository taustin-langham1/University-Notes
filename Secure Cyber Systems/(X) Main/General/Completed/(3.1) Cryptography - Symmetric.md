what requires synchronization?
- only CTR

message authentication stuff timeline lmao

**First encrypt** the plaintext using your encryption standard, and symmetric encryption scheme such as a stream cipher or a block cipher. block ciphers like CBC and CFB modes are a little weird though because they propagate errors, so maybe use a ECB or CTR encryption scheme to produce a ciphertext with error localizing, so only the corrupted block is affected. then compute the MAC over the cipher text, so that attacks where an adversary manipulates ciphertext before MAC verification cannot occur. 
If the MAC came before the encryption, the MAC wouldn't protect the ciphertext directly, but the plaintext
