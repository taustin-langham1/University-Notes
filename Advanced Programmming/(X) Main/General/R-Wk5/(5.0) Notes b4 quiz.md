### recursion



sumList :: [Int] -> Int
sumList [] = 0   -- base case
sumList (x:xs) = x + sumList xs -- recursive case


length' :: [a] -> Int
length' []     = 0                   -- Base case
length' (_:xs) = 1 + length' xs      -- Recursive case (ignores head)


factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial 0 = 1                      -- Base case
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)   -- Recursive case



**head vs tail recursion**



**head recursion**
factorial 3 = 3 * (factorial 2) = 3 * (2 * (factorial 1)) = ...

-- danger of stack overflow for large values of n (3 here)

**tail recursion**

less intuitive than head recursion, needs an accumulator to keep safe


factorialTR :: Int -> Int -> Int
factorialTR 0 acc = acc
factorialTR n acc = factorialTR (n - 1) (n * acc)



**Higher order functions**
