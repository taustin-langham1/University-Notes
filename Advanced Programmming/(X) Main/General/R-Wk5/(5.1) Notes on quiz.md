###### **higher order functions i think**


**any**

"it checks if at least one element in a list satisfies a predicate" 

**map**

"it applies a function to each element of a list and returns a new list of the results"

**takeWhile**

"It takes elements from the beginning of the list as long as they satisfy a predicate."

**dropWhile**

"It drops elements from the list while they satisfy a predicate, returning the rest."




**foldr**
(a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b

foldr (+) 0 [1, 2, 3] -- 1 + (2 + (3 + 0)) = 6

"recursively reduces a list from the right to a single value, using a combining function" 

**foldl**
(b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b

foldl (+)  0  [1, 2, 3] -- ((0 + 1) + 2) + 3 = 6

"it recursively reduces a list from the left to a single value, using a combining function" 


**What is the result of the following expression in Haskell: (f . g) x**

(f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x))

**all**

"bool"

(a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool

all even [2, 4, 6] = True

**head recursion**





**tail recursion**




**filter**

"it returns a new list that contains only elements satisfying the given predicate"
