Carried functions, Lambda functions, Conditional Expressions, Recursion
#### Carried Functions

- functions with multiple arguments are also possible by returning functions as results

#### Lambda Functions

- functions can be constructed without naming the functions by lambda expressions

#### Operator Sections

- an operator written between its two arguments can be converted into a curried function written before its two arguments by using parenthesis

#### Conditional Expressions

- as in most programming languages, functions can be defined using conditional expressions

#### Case Expressions

- as an alternative to if/else, functions can also be defined using case expressions

#### Guarded Equeations

- as an alternative to conditionals, functions can also be defined using guarded equations

#### Pattern Matching 

- many functions have a particularly clear definition using pattern matching on their arguments

#### List Patterns

- internally, every non-empty list is constructed by repeated use of an operator (:) called "cons" that adds an element to the start of the list

#### Maybe/Either types

- in Haskell, maybe and either are data types used for handling computations that might fail or produce uncertain results
