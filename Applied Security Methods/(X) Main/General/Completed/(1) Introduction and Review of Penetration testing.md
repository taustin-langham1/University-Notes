1. **What is Pen testing?** and what is its scope?

find and exploit vulnerabilities in a
computer system
to identify
weak spots

## **what are some typical pentesting scenarios**

**Vulnerability identification in bespoke software:**
Used to give feedback to developers on coding practices
which prevent the vulnerabilities identified.

**Scenario driven testing aimed at identifying vulnerabilities:**
The penetration testers explore a particular scenario to
discover if it leads to a vulnerability.

**Scenario driven testing of detection and response capability:**
The aim is to also gauge the detection and response capabilities
your organization has in place

## **What are some key limitations of pentesting**

Not intended to be a comprehensive evaluation of security, many
security issues and configuration problems may not be identified.
The amount of information that can be gathered in a given time
period is limited
if the limited nature of a penetration test is not understood, the test
can give the target organization a false sense of security

## **What are some legal issues regarding a pen test?**

The main thing that separates a penetration tester from an attacker
is permission.
What constitutes 'authorization' and who can authorize such access
can quickly get muddy!
It is important that consent is also obtained from any owners of 3rd
party hosting environments or equipment, which may also come
under the scope of testing.

## What are the four stages of pentesting? explain each step.


1. Planning
	1. identify rules
	2. finalize and document management approval
	3. set test goals
2. Discovery
	1. recon
	2. scanning
	3. enum
3. Attack
	1. gaining access
	2. escalating privileges
	3. system browsing
4. Discovery again attack again (loop)
5. Reporting
	1. lack of security policy
	2. poorly enforced policy
	3. mis config
	4. software reliability
	5. failure to apply patches
