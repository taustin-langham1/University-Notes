**Non-repudiation**

- can be achieved only by symmetric encryption - as with asymmetric encryption, only the sender can produce a signature

Consider two entities that do not know each other but want to send encrypted messages over a channel. The two entities can establish a shared secret using Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which can be used to derive a key for a symmetric encryption system, for example AES. 

Alternatively, the two entities can using a asymmetric encryption system, for example RSA.



Diffie-Hellman key exchange, public key encryption, RSA, Digital signatures and RSA signatures

Diffie Hellman is used to securely exchange a key



RSA 
- weaknesses 
	- slow encryption speeds, security issues when encrypting long plaintexts
- strengths
	- does not require secure key exchange 
	- no need for symmetric trust


• Describe how to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange to generate a
shared secret.



• Explain how RSA encryption and decryption operates.



• Explain how to implement RSA encryption securely.

Use large keys, propper padding and avoide side channel attacks
never reuse keys for encrypting/signing

padding prevents mathematical attacks

small keys can be factored 

if a key is compromised 

• Describe how to modify RSA into a signature scheme and
understand the security services it provides.



DEFFIE HELLMAN SECURE KEY EXCHANGE

Suppose p = 23 and g = 11 - are two system wide params

Alice pick an integer a = 2 and bob picks an integer b = 4

what is the shared secret value between Alice and bob if using deffie hellman key exchange

**the goal is to find the shared secret value that allice and bob will compute independently after exchanging some public values**

**Prime p = 23** and a **base g = 11**

allice private key a is 2 and bobs is b = 4

so alice computes hers A/B = g^a/b mod p

g = 11
p = 23
so its

A = 11^2  mod 23 = 6
B = 11^4  mod 23 = 13

compute S = 13^2 mod 23 (alice) = 8
compute S = 6^4 mod 23 (bob) = 8

##### easier Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol 

**Alice**
Xa = g^a = 11^2 = 6 (mod 23) and send Xa to Bob

**Bob**
Xb = g^b = 11^4 = 13 (mod 23) and send Xb to Alice

**Alice/Bob 2**
Alice computes (Xb)^a = 13^2 = 8 (mod 23) Bob computes (Xa)^b

alice and bob now share secret key 8

**Alice and Bob**

## RSA encryption

The RSA encryption system will be broken if large numbers can be factored - an attacker can compute p and q from N, and then can compute the secret decryption key


**Decryption key**
ed = 1 mod (p-1)(q-1)
this means that
7d = 1 mod 60
by trail and error, or using EEA, we get d = 43


**Message encryption**
c = m^e mod n 
= 3^7 mod 77
= 31 mod 77


**Decryption of ciphertext**

m = c^d mod n

= 2^37 mod 77
=51 mod 77
