**WEEK 10 and WEEK 9 QUIZ**



• Explain the role of formal methods in assessing cyber security of
systems

**THE FOUNDATIONS, METHODS, AND TOOLS FOR DEVELOPING AND REASONING ABOUT SYSTEMS**

**They allow us to rigorously and formally check whether a system satisfies defined security properties**

formal methods are techniques used to specify, develop, and verify software and hardware systems. in cybersecurity, they help ensure that system behave exactly as intended without vulnerabilities


• Explain the advantages and limitations of formal methods

high assurance: strong confidence

early error detection: catches flaws early in design/before implementation

Complexity & Scalability are downsides

• Select appropriate methods and tools to assess the cyber security
of systems
