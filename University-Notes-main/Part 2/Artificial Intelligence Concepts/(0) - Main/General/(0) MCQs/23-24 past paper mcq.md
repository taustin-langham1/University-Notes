a) 𝑘-means clustering cannot handle datasets with outliers effectively.
b) 𝑘-means clustering always converges to the same solution regardless of the initial
cluster centroids.
c) 𝑘-means clustering is not suitable for datasets with high dimensionality.

c - can handle but performance may downgrade

d) 𝑘-means clustering cannot accommodate different distance functions.


A) AS OUTLIERS CAN DISTORT THE POSITION OF CENTRIODS, DUE TO MINIMIZING SQUARED DISTANCES

ii) Which of the following statements are correct? [1 mark]


a) The memory to store facts is a positive of declarative knowledge.

b) Imperative knowledge is limited by the assumption that the past predicts the
future.

c) Declarative knowledge focuses on generalisation while imperative knowledge
focuses on memorisation.

d) Declarative knowledge involves the deduction of new facts from old facts.



iii) In machine learning, which of the following statements accurately describes the
distinction between linearly separable and nonlinear decision boundaries? [2 marks]


a) Linearly separable boundaries can be represented by a straight line or plane, while
nonlinear boundaries require complex curves or surfaces to separate the classes.


linearly separable boundaries can be represented by a straight line or plane. while non linear boundaries require complex curves to separate the classes


b) Linearly separable boundaries can handle only two classes, while nonlinear
boundaries are capable of handling multiple classes.

c) Linearly separable boundaries are insensitive to outliers, while nonlinear
boundaries are more robust in the presence of noisy data.

d) Linearly separable boundaries are less computationally efficient to train compared
to nonlinear boundaries due to their inherent complexity.




.a State what overfitting means, the key issue that it causes for machine learning algorithms
and describe a method of mitigating overfitting in decision trees.
[3 marks]

**Overfitting occurs when a model learns not only the underlying patterns in the training data but also the noise. This causes poor generalisation to new, unseen data.**

The **key issue** is that the model performs well on training data but poorly on test data, indicating **high variance** and low predictive reliability.

In **decision trees**, one method to mitigate overfitting is to **limit the maximum depth** of the tree. This constrains the model's complexity, reducing the risk of capturing noise and forcing the tree to generalize more broadly.




3.b Multiple Choice Questions.
i) Which of the following statements accurately describes a characteristic of decision
trees? [1 mark]

a) Decision trees are exclusively used in regression analysis.
- Decision trees can be used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks.

b) Decision trees cannot handle both categorical and numerical data.
Decision trees **can handle both** types of data.

c) Decision trees do not support handling of missing values in the dataset.
Some decision tree implementations (like in scikit-learn or C4.5) **can handle missing values**.

d) None of the above.









iii) In a binary classification task using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a neural network
is designed with the following specifications: The network consists of two hidden
layers. The first hidden layer contains 8 neurons, and the second hidden layer consists
of 6 neurons. The input to the network is flattened grayscale images with dimensions
of 28×28 pixels. The output layer consists of a single neuron representing the binary
classification. Each neuron in the network uses a sigmoid activation function. What is
the total number of parameters in this MLP? [2 marks]

a) 6,340
b) 6,287
c) 6,341
d) 6,286
