# Euclidian Distance 
**Most Mentioned**

Dist(d) = _/ (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2

# Squared Euclidian Distance

d = (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2

# Manhattan Distance
is the sum of the absolute differences between coordinates of two points

p = (2,3)
q = (5,1)

qx - px + qy - py = distance (p,q)
# Cosine Distance
