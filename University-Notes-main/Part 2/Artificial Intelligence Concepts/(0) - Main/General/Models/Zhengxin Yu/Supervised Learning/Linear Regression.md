## Notes on this question!







# Notes
**The Primary Focus On Notes Should Be Around Answering These Types Of Questions**

Functions:

Loss function j 

J = (y - y^)^2
FOR ALL y,y^ pairs





**regression**
- a return to a former or less developed state

**linear**
- relationship between the dependent variable (y) and the independent variable (x)

y = actual value, y^ = predicted value



Dependent = variable being predicted
Independent = input features used to explain or influence the dependent varibale


**LINEAR + REGRESSION = LINEAR REGRESSION!!!!**

predict relationships between variables, by fitting a line that minimizes prediction errors


#### Least Squares Method

**LOSS FUNCTION**


- loss function J quantifies the distance between the real and predicted values of the target (Low is better!)

LOSS FUNCTION = J

J = loss of point 1(y - y^)^2

y^ = wx + b
w = slope
b = intercep

so it like this:
