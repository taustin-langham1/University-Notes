unsupervised is cheaper

types of unsupervised learning:

**Clustering** - dividing points into clusters
**Dimensional reduction** - reduce number of features 
**Association rule mining** - series algorithm to find probability of co-occurance of items in a collection
**Anomaly detection** - techniques that discover unusual data points in a dataset - patterns that deviate from normal dataset patterns

**Supervised Learning**

- Supervised as in **"Labeled data"** - trained using examples that include the correct answers
- Direct feedback in the 'Evaluation' measure
- Predict Outcome

**Unsupervised Learning**

- Unsupervised as in **'No labels'**
- No feedback
- Find hidden structures


**Reinforcement Learning**
- Decision Process
- Reward system
- Learn series of actions


# Supervised

ML algorithm
- A procedure that iteratively learns patterns from data
ML model
- A model is a mathematical representation that makes predictions based on learned patterns from data


## Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification)

>- If Y is a numerical value, we call it a **regression** problem
>
>- if Y is a category, we call it a **classification** problem

# Classification Vs Regression 
**Regression**
- predict a continuous numerical value as the output based on input

**Classification**
- predict a categorical value, representing distinct classes or categories
