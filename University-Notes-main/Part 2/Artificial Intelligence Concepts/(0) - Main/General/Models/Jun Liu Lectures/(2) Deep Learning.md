# Convolution Basics, Current Research in AI, and an Introduction to Deep Learning


Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad concept. It
encompasses any technique that enables
machines to mimic human behavior.

• Not limited to any specific method or algorithm. It includes both
rule-based systems and systems that learn from data.

• Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI. It
focuses on systems that learn from and make
predictions (or decisions) based on data.

• Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML. It uses
neural networks with many layers to model
complex patterns in data.
