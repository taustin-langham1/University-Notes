- what is supervised learning?
- Supervised Learning Algorithm - Linear regression
- Model evaluation - regression


### Key components in ML

data - training dataset: used to train ml algorithm enabling it to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs

feature - Individual measurable properties or characteristics of data used as input values for algorithms 

ml algorithm - a procedure that iteratively learns patterns from data

ml model - a model is a mathematical representation that makes predictions based on learned patterns from data

model parameters - the internal variables of a model that are learned from data during training

𝑦 = w𝑥 + 𝒃

test dataset - to evaluate the performance of a trained ML model 

prediction - the output generated by a model when it processes input data

evaluation - measure how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data, often using metrics - mean squared error, accuracy, recall, etc.

## Types of machine learning

- Supervised learning - 
	- Labeled data
	- Direct feedback
	- Predict outcome
	
- Unsupervised learning - 
	- No labels 
	- No feedback
	- find hidden structure

- Reinforcement learning - 
	- Decision process
	- Reward system
	- Learn series of actions



### Supervised Learning


supervised learning algorithm is trained using labelled datasets
	each input is paired with a corresponding correct output
learn to map an input to a particular output
learn from experience to make predictions on new unseen data
similar to a teacher-student scenario

- the algorithm will teach itself to identify changes in Y based on the values of X
	- prediction, presented with new X, the algorithm will be able to predict how Y would be like
	- a dataset of labelled data is required
- The key characteristic of supervised learning: the learning algorithm is trained using examples that include the correct answers
- if Y is a numerical value, we call it a regression problem
- if Y is a category, we call it a classification problem


#### Regression

predict a continuous numerical value as the output based on input 
example: stock price prediction 
task is to predict stock price at future date


#### Classification

Predict a categorical value, representing distinct classes or categories
example: email spam classifier

(supervised learning) there are countless ways to do that; each algorithm does it in its own way

linear regression
logistic regression
k-nearest neighbors 
decision tress
naive bayes

## Linear Regression


(most widely utilized version)

- regression: a return to a former or less developed state
- linear: 
	- the relationship between the dependent variable (y) and the independent variable (x) is modelled as a linear combination of the parameters
	- dependent variable: the variable being predicted
	- independent variable: the input features used to explain or influence the dependent variable

- linear regression: predict relationships between variables by fitting a line that maximizes prediction errors

regression toward the mean

loss function - least squares method

loss function J quantifies the distance between the real and predicted values of the target

### Evaluation: performance metrics

- mean squared error (MSE) 
	- the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values
	- it tends to emphasize larger errors due to squaring (focus on larger deviations)
- Mean absolute error (MAE)
	- The average of the absolute differences between predicted an actual values
	- it treats all errors equally, making it more robust to extreme values


### Regression and classification

- regression problem:
	- Predict a continuous-valued output
	- the output is a numerical value
- classification problem:
	- Attempt to separate the data into specific categories
	- the output is a category

### classification

- model predicts categories, small number of possible outputs
