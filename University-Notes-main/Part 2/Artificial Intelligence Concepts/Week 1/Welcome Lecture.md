#### Risks of Ai

- energy consumption
- privacy
- security

#### Ai and Ethics

- Ai bias
- Ai Fairness
- Ai in Education

#### How can we define Ai?

- "human made thinking power"
- perform human tasks which normally require human intelligence

Approach 1:
- thinking humanly: cognitive modelling approach
	- model human cognitive process
		- perception
		- reasoning
		- problem solving
Approach 2
- acting humanly: the Turing test
Approach 3
- Thinking rationally: Laws of thought approach
	- based on formal logic and reasoning principles
	- use rules to think logically and make decisions
Approach 4
- Acting rationally: Rational agents approach
	- take actions based on given inputs
	- maximize the expected performance
	- handle uncertainty and adapt to change

#### What is machine learning?

>“A computer is said to learn from experience 
   E with respect to task T and some
   performance measure P, if its performance
   on T, as measured by P, improved with
   experience E”

learning from experience, and reinforcing what they've learnt to make 'better' decisions

 Task (T):
➢ The specific activity or problem the ML system is designed to solve,
such as classifying images, predicting prices or translating text.
 Performance Measure (P):
➢ The metric used to evaluate how well the model is performing the
task, such as accuracy, precision, or mean squared error.
 Experience(E):
➢ The data the model uses to improve its understanding of the task, such
as a dataset of labelled examples or feedback from the environment.

machine learning drives AI
- the design and development of algorithms that can learn from data
deep learning
- a subset of ML with additional layers to learn deeper representations of data
Generative AI
- a type of DL model focused on generating new content with human-like creativi
