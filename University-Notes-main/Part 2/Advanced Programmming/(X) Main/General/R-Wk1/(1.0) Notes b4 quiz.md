intro lecture, not much to add, wondering what the formative quiz will look like




tail (get tail of list)
take
!! x  = take x from list

f a b + c*d  =  apply the function f to a and b, and add the result to the product of c and d


statically-typed language (like C, Java).

Functional programming uses pure functions and immutable data.

"immutable data" = cannot change data after it has been stated 

No state makes code more predictable.

Impure languages may introduce functional concepts, but with
limitations.
