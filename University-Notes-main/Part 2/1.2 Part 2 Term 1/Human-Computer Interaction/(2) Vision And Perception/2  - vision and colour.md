• Computer monitors on the desktop are usually set up so that they
do not extend over more than 40 degrees in the user’s visual field.
Why is that?

**Comfortable eye movement:**

**Max. 20 degrees to left/right**
**up to 30 degree down from the heads center, so even 40 is pushing the limits of ergonomic viewing range without need for head movement.**

• In the early days of the WWW, hyperlinks were often highlighted by
blue font colour. Was that a good choice? What might be limitations
of blue for highlighting text?

**likely not, as it exists within the SHORT cones of the eye, instead of the MEDIUM or LONG, so we have a much lower sensitivity for a blue than a red or a green**


• Do we have better colour vision in the fovea or in the periphery?

**our colour perception comes from the cones in the fovea (central retina), and there are more rods in the periphery. so fovea.**

• What colour do we find at the center of an RGB cube?

- **RGB cube = (0,0,0), so black**

• In colouring a map, how can we ensure that people with colour
vision deficiency can discriminate the different regions?

**Ensure a light-dark contrast is more profound and relied upon than the colour dependency. add readable texts, shapes, or outlines. - or textures, crosshatching, stripes, dots, etc.**
