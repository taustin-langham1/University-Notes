## Gestalt - perception of form - analyze visual designs in terms of Gestalt

visual search - effects of relevance to visual search and perception of objects

Preattentive processing  

visual encoding of data - visual features to communicate data effectively and efficiently

**Gestalt**
how we find order in what we see
how we recognize groups, relationships and patterns
how we see individual elements as a whole
how we simplify complex images when we perceive objects


# PERCEPTION OF OBJECTS
## Emergence 
(think the picture emerging from the sum of its elements)

- "seeing the bigger picture", seeing the larger picture without analysis of the whole
## Closure 
(think of the mind 'filling in the gaps' of commonly assumed shapes//extrapolation)

## Continuity
Think extrapolation again, but of a path. seeing a continuous shape even if partly occluded


# PERCEPTION OF GROUPS
## Proximity
objects that are closer are perceived as a group (i.e., one direction when theyre together, harry liam nial zayne when theyre apart)

## Similarity 
objects that share visual characteristics are perceived as grouped (think white umbrellas in a sea of black ones)

## common region
objects in the same region are perceived as one group 'enclosure'

# PERCEPTION OF IMAGE STRUCTURE

## Figure/Ground

to simplify an image, the brain separates foreground ("figure") from background ("ground")

important, as images in the foreground have more attention
separation is supported by contrast
smaller brighter crisper objects are perceived as in front
