# ethics

• By conducting research ethics reviews and adhering to guidelines we ensure
that participation is
• Voluntary: Do not coerce people into taking part
• Informed: Provide accurate information about what the study entails
• Safe: Do not expose participants to unsafe situations or practices.



effectiveness efficiency satisfaction

general formula for experiment variables:
• Choose appropriate metrics based on your study goals
• Clearly identify your variables
• Assign a name to each factor you study, and to each level or test condition
and use these names consistently
• Assign a name to each dependent variable, and report the units in which
they are measured, or scale on which they are measured
• Pilot test how measurements are taken to ensure that data is recorded
consistently and correctly


**SAMPLING**
 Experiments can produce statistically valid conclusions with relatively small samples
• Ideally, the results of a study should hold for people in a target population who were not tested

**ANALYSIS**

Descriptive statistics are used to describing one data set
the differences between
the designs, and the effect of those differences on performance and UX
