User Centered Design - the user needs?

Prototyping, Storyboards, Sketching and Paper prototypes


4 stage model of user centered design

**Research: Understand the users' needs preferences and behaviors*


**Requirements: define requirements**


**Design: create solutions based on the requirements**


**Evaluation: Test the designed solutions with real users**



Research -> requirements -> Design (prototyping, storyboarding, sketching and paper prototypes) -> Evaluation

• Rapid prototyping with multiple iterations is good
• Explore more possibilities, and possibly combine solutions
• Eliminate bad starting ideas
 Separates designer’s ego from the design ideas
• One baby versus many babies
• Can be more receptive of criticism
• Encourages comparison of different possibilities
