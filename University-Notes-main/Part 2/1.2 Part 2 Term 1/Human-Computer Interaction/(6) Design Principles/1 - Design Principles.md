**• Visibility**

• Out of sight, out of mind!
• Discoverability: the ease in which users can
	• Find out what they are possible actions are
	• Navigate the interface and find what they are looking for
	• Visibility of system status
• Only by knowing the current system status can you change it
	• A lack of information equates to a lack of control
	• Lack of visible response leads users to think their action had no effect
	• Multiple clicks because system didn’t respond …


**• Affordances**

a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine how it may be used

"chair affords sitting - but only depending on who or why someone is using the object, it may afford throwing, or stacking, or knocking over"


• A central challenge of designing a user interface is to decide what affordances an interface will have and how to signify that they exist
• Affordances and signifiers address the gulf of execution
• What can I do? How can I do it?
• Signifiers are the signalling component of an affordance
• Making users aware of available actions, and indicating how to perform them
• Ideally, a user interface lets a user perceive at a glance what they can do
• But that’s not always possible



**• Signifiers**

signifiers are indicators, or signals, that convey appropriate behavior to users, signifiers communicate where and what kind of actions is required - signifiers are design properties that can announce affordances


**• Constraints**

**Limit the actor**

physical - safety catch etc

semantic - move cursor into 'void'

logical - enforce logical order of steps in a task, limit data entry to logical range

cultural - red as signal to stop


**• Feedback**

• Knowing the current status of a system empowers users to change the
status in accordance with their goals
• Communicating the status of the system to the user creates trust: users feel
in control
• Appropriate feedback is important, as users need to know whether their
actions are successful
• Providing immediate feedback allows users to quickly identify the source of
errors and fix them as soon as they were made
