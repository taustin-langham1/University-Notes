• Golden Rules / Heuristics
• Standards
• UI Design Patterns
• UI Style Guides

**EIGHT GOLDEN RULES**


1. Consistency
2. Universality
3. Feedback
4. Closure
5. Prevent Errors
6. Quick Reversal
7. Keep users in control
8. reduce short-term memory load

• Golden Rules are general but more actionable than design principles
• Derived from experience and refined over time
• Apply generally in many situations but not as a strict rule
• Require interpretation and adjustment for different design contexts


**Standards**

• Agreement by stakeholders

• Apply generally in many situations

• High level of authority

• Agreed point of reference

• Referred in regulations

• Conformance can be tested/enforced


**UI DESIGN / STYLE GUIDES**


• Design Patterns have in common with golden rules and design
heuristics that they are derived from experience
• But they have a narrower focus, addressing specific problems
• They provide clear solutions with examples
• They provide guidance on when to use, and when not to

• User interface design patterns are recurring solutions that solve common
design problems
• Patterns emerge from practice
• A pattern typically describes
• A common design problem
• The context or situation where it occurs
• A solution for the problem
• A rationale for the solution
• Examples that illustrate the pattern

• Style guides are a design standard for specific products, platforms or libraries
• Style guides define
• What the UI should look like
• How it is operated
• How it reacts to input
• What it feels like
• The purpose is to support consistency across design teams and applications
• Usually most rules are “encoded” in the libraries, frameworks and UI builder

• Standards and regulations provide rules that designs must conform too
• General in nature but testable
• Design patterns capture user interface design wisdom
• Specific to a user interface design problem, but applicable to different
situations, devices and platforms
• Style guides provide guidelines on user interface look&feel and behaviour
• Specific to devices, operating systems or widget libraries
• For UI design, you don’t need to learn standards and guidelines
• But you need to know where to find them and how to read them
