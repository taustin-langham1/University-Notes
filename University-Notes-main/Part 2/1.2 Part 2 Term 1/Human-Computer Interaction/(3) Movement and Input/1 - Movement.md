**Fitts' Law**

movement and input are subject to a speed-accuracy trade-off

most input in HCI is based on aimed movements
	reaching for controls, pointing the mouse, typing 

Aimed movements can be modelled using Fitts' law
modelling the difficulty of input tasks 
modelling the performance with different devices
throughput is a measure of input performance that takes both speed and accuracy into account

combine distance and width into a single index of difficulty, measured in bits

the formulation has become refined into

**ID = Log2(D/W + 1)**



#### KLM keystroke-level model

- klm defines a set of basic input operators

**physical motor operators vs mental operators** (then system response)
