(1) What does the term 'usability' refer to in the context of an interactive system?

- the quality of the user interface in how it lets users achieve the goals the system is meant to support

(2) The 'MHP' model predicts reaction time of 240ms for a user to react to a stimulus, based on cycle times of 100ms for perception, 70 ms for cognition and 70 for motor response , according to the model, what would be the reaction time if the task involved

according the the mhp model, what would be the reaction time if the task also involved a choice

100 = perception + 70 for congnition+ 70 for motor response = 240 react // + 70 for cognition of choice  = 310 ms

(3) How long can information be held in working memory?
(10 seconds)

(4) ![[Pasted image 20250506130437.png]]

what does this show? Continuity / Proximity / Enclosure / Connection?

- Continuity

(5) Spotlight is a metaphor for what kind of attention?

Focused/Selective/Sustained/Divided?

- Focused

(6) The first gap is called the Gulf of '**execution**'  which emerges even before the user begins interacting with the system. This related to the '**Interaction**' possibilities of the system as compared to the person's '**mental**' model of the system or task. 

The second gap is called the Guld of '**Evaluation**' which emerges as the user tries to understand and match the state of the system in response to their inputs. A good design practice that helps bridge this gulf involves providing '**Feedback**'

1. Effect of Distance: Increasing distance while keeping target size fixed increases MT as seen with column A,B,C,D 
2. Effect of Size: Increasing the target size while keeping distance fixed decreases MT (e.g., D,H,L,P)
3. Interaction (Size vs Distance): Halving size has the same effect as doubling distance, both increase MT (C,G,H)
4. Interaction (Size vs Distance): Simultaneously doubling both distance and size has no effect on MT (A,E,K,P)
