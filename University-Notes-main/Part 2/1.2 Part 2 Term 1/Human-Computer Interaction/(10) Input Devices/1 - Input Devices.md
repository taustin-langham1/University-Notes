action                   input


The same kind of input can be sensed by different input devices


Devices differ in what they sense, and in states and events they support


Interaction techniques build on device states, to provide users with
methods to perform input


What devices sense as input can be mapped in different ways to feedback
on the display, and input to the system/application


Modes enable user interfaces to support more functions than there are
distinct controls. Use with caution
