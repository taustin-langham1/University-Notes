Metaphors for different forms of Attention


**Spotlight** -> **Focused Attention**:

Focused Attention - **Working Memory** - SPOTLIGHT MEMORY

Focused attention determines what we have in working memory

> how is attention allocated? **Selective attention, select one thing at a time to focus on, Attention cueing, directing attention**


**FILTER**  -> **Selective attention**

Ability to focus attention on one stimulus while ignoring distractions
FILTER MODEL
OVERT / COVERT ATTENTION (WHAT WE SEE VS WHAT WE NOTICE)



**ATTENTUATION** -> **AUDITORY ATTENTION CONTROL**
COCKTAIL PARTY EFFECT

What is the top down // bottom up model of attention?



**Top-down:**
based on our goals (think internal attention cueing)

**Bottom-up:**
Driven by sensory stimuli (think external, involuntary attention cueing)




**Multitasking**

##### MULTIPLE RESOURCE THEORY OF ATTENTION


divided attention / multitasking 

multiple resource theory of attention


1 - People have a limited set of cognitive resources available 

2 - Attention to tasks draws on certain resources

3 - Some tasks can be performed at the same time, because they draw on resources that do not interfere with each other

4- other tasks require altering attention, because they conflict in the resources they require

**processing stages**

- Perception and Cognition draw on shared resources (working memory)
-  But we can attend to new stimuli while responding to prior ones

**Modality**

- Different modalities draw on different resources: audio, video, tactile,..

**Visual processing**

- Different resources for foveal processing and peripheral awareness

**Codes**

- Different resources for information that is spatial versus semantic



Questions: 

**Describe in one sentence how working memory and focused attention are related**

Focused attention is directly what we're spotlighting in our mind, which must exist within our immediate working memory.

**Give an example each for bottom-up attention and top-down attention in your interaction with computers. Do that for both visual attention and auditory attention**

an example for bottom-up attention in computers may be advertisements on webpages, which draw us away from where our attention may have been self-focused. top-down attention may be directly googling something within our own personal interest, without any input from external cues.

**Explain the difference between change blindness and inattentional blindness**

Change blindness is having attention on something but still managing to overlook changes, whereas in attentional bias is missing something, as we don't have any attention directed towards it

**How can change blindness be avoided in user interfaces**

By giving more direct intentional cues to direct attention towards changes in the user interface, and minimizing the distractions that could draw away from the change.
