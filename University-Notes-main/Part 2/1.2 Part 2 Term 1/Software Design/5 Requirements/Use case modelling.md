Include and 

Extend

, extend is for when a use case conditionally adds steps to another use case (optional or uncommon // anything other than a mandatory extension to a use case)

, include is used when something is a mandatory conditional behavior, when use case fragments are extracted

keep eye out for required/possible use cases before designing the diagram
