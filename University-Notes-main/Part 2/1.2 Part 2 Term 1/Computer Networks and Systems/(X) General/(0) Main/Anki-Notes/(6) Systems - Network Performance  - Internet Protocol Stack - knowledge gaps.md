key challenges:

dealing with noise, cross-talk, bit-errors



Copper, Radio, Fiber

**Duplex**

half-duplex, nodes at both ends of link can transmit - not at the same time 

full-duplex, nodes at both ends of link can transmit


EDC & D = 

EDC = error detection and correction bits 

D = Data

LARGER EDC FILED YIELDS BETTER DETECTION AND CORRECTION


**Multiple access links**

point to point Multiple Access Links
- 1-1

Broadcast multiple access links 
- M-N
- requires MAC protocols


	- MAC - medium access control
		- prevent collisions, coordinate transmissions, ensure fair and efficient use of the channel


MAC "taking turns", "random access", "channel partitioning"

- channel partitioning protocols: Fixed parts
- TDMA - time slots
- FDMA - frequency bands
- CDMA - unique codes


- devices transmit at will, retry after collisions. wait random time.
	- ALOHA (wait random time before resend)
	- CSMA carrier sense multiple access  
	- CSMA/CD collision detection (ethernet)
	- CSMA/CA collision avoidance (WIFI)
