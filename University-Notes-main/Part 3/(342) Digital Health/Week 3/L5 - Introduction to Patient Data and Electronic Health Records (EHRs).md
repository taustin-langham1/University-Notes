Health Data is any information about a person's physical or mental health: in the past, at the present or in the future


## Sources of health data

**clinical data** - most common

**patient-generated**  - these are both useful, but are under utilised and considered 
**contextual data**

## Primary use for health data

- primary:
	- collected for healthcare to the person it was collected from
	- storage enables effective provision of healthcare
	- EHRs originally designed for clinical documentation and admin
- secondary:
	- information other than those for the original primary reason they were collected for
	- enhance disease detection and surveillance
	- inform health policy and research 
	- provide clinical prediction, detection, and treatment recommendation

# EHRs

- A longitudinal electronic record of patient health information generated by one or more encounters in any care delivery setting
	- various definitions exist, but broadly, EHRs are digital records that store comprehensive, up-to-date health information about individuals 
	- interoperability needed to enable the exchange of health data across organisations

### Terminology - EHR, EMR, EPR, PHR

- EMR: (Electronic Medical Record)
- EHR: (Electronic Health Record) - more detailed report of patients health
- EPR: (Electronic Patient Record)
- PHR: (Personal Health Record)


### Benefits and Challenges of EHRs

Benefits:
	improved acess and sharing of patient information
	enhanced clinical decision-making
	better continuity of care
	research and population health opportunities
challenges:
	Data entry burden and workflow issues
	privacy and security concerns
	interoperability and system integration challenges
	cost and training requirements
	data quality

## Structured vs Unstructured health data

- structured data: pre-defined format, organised, quantitative
- unstructured data: lacks pre-defined format, unorganised, qualitative (often)
- semi-structured data: has some organisational properties, but does not conform to strict tabular formats. Examples include JSON, XML, and NoSQL documents.

• **Unstructured text** e.g., “Patient was involved in a car crash
and presented to the ER with pain, vomiting, and mild dizziness.
Most likely they are concussed but should follow up with a head
CT to confirm no other brain injuries”
• Rich detail, natural for clinicians
• Hard to analyse, ambiguous

• **Semi-structured text** e.g., {“Symptoms”: “Head pain, dizziness,
emesis”, “Cause”: “Car crash”, “Diagnosis”: “Likely
concussion”....}
• Data not strictly structured but follows a predictable format:
Key-value pairs, tagged fields, easier to parse than unstructured
• Inconsistent formats

• **Structured text** e.g., SNOMED/ICD-10 codes
• Highly standardized and computable
• May oversimplify clinical nuance and time-consuming to
generate manually
### Common data types of EHRs

**data types**
demographics
diagnoses
problem list
family history
allergies
immunisation
medications
procedures
lab orders
vital signs
reports
utilisation


## Clinical Coding Systems

- many different coding systems exist
	- can group into two different types of clinical coding - classification and terminology
		- classifications (ICD) give specific codes to 'groups' of illness, symptoms, or procedures
		- terminology (SNOWMED-CT) give specific codes for each 'individual' illness, symptom, procedure or medicine
		- the focus for terminologies is on what makes individual patients different from each other, not what they have in common as for classifications

### ICD

international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems (ICD)
- the ICD is maintained by the WHO
- ICD identifies a set of health conditions and health practices and tries to assign alphanumeric codes to them
- ICD coded data are usually used for research
- many updates to ICD codes (ICD-11/10)

• Shortness of breath - R06.02
• Nausea (without vomiting) - R11.0
• Headache (unspecified) - R51.9
• Asthma intermittent (mild) - J45.20
• Fever (unspecified) - R50.9
• Note in practice, you generally would not code shortness of breath (R06.02) if it’s
clearly attributable to the already diagnosed asthma (J45.20)
• So, overall J45.20, R11.0, R51.9, R50.9 (assuming primary reason for visit is asthma)
• In practice clinical coding complex due the need to accurately interpret
nuanced clinical notes 21 / 39

## SNOMED CT

Systematised nomenclature of medicine (Clinical Terms)

- a clinical terminology
- the core component types are; concepts, descriptions, and relationships
- each clinical idea has a unique numeric concept ID
- descriptions - all human readable terms linked to a concept
- relationships - the logical links between concepts, **IS A** relationships define the hierarchy, attribute,, relationships define properties
- Child concept **IS A** Parent concept

### Physiological signals

- time series data - sequence of data points indexed in time order
- signals vary continuously, but measured by sampling repeatedly over time
- physiological signals often sampled at fixed sampling rate

-

- **Completeness**
	• Missing or incomplete data.
	• Information buried in unstructured data making it effectively ‘missing’
- **Consistency**
	• Duplicated or fragmented records
	• Different physicians may document the same diagnosis differently.
	• Coding variations: e.g. use of outdated or localized ICD/SNOMED codes
- **Correctness**
	• Errors from manual entry, misscoding, or outdated data.
	• Delayed data entry: Time lags reduce the value of real-time surveillance.
	• Extracting information from unstructured data can introduce errors
	• Patient adherence and compliance: For example, prescriptions reflect the
	orders written by providers, but not necessarily patient compliance


## Interoperability

Interoperability is the ability of two or more components or systems to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged

- **syntactic interoperability** allows two or more systems to communicate and exchange data
	- standards for data representation and interchange
	- data is exchanged between systems using standardised formats
- **semantic interoperability**
	- ensures not just the format but also the meaning of the data is understood
		- data uses standardised classifications and terminologies


### FHIR

first healthcare interoperability resoruces

- web based standard / framework for secure exchange of electronic healthcare information across disparate sources
- based on 'resource' elements that contain information to be exchanged, as a JSON or XML object
