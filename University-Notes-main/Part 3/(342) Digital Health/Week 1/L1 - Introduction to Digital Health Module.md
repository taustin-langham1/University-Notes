CW - in lab quiz Week 10 Tutorial

### Digital health: definition and purposes

- data collection, diagnosis, prediction, and interventions

- Self-tracking - wellness technologies
	- lifestyle and well-being optimisation
	- most are not clinically validated nor regulated as medical devices

- digital health technologies
	- clinically validated and regulated for improvement of health outcomes
	- improve healthcare professionals oversight
	- clinical accountability, i.e., clear responsibility if harm occurs in their use


patient lead:
- Data collection - kernel of the process
Clinician lead:
- Diagnosis
- Prediction
Patient & Clinician lead:
- Interventions - overall result

##### Digital Health:  (1) Data Collection
Data collection captures patient- and clinician-generated data to support diagnosis, prediction, interventions
- Patients technologies
	- Wearable monitors
	- Symptom logs
	- Validated and regulated technologies qualify as digital health technologies
- Clinicians traditional technologies: clinical data sources
	- Lab tests, imaging
	- Functional tests, clinical notes
	- generative objective data
	- integrate clinical data with Electronic Health Records (EHR) system, and if possible, patient generated data

##### Digital Health: (2) Diagnosis
Diagnosis interprets collected data to identify or confirm specific health conditions
Patient 
- Symptoms-checker apps - collect and analyse self-reported symptoms 
	- validated and regulated technologies qualify as digital health technologies
	- provide early, patient-facing triage or prompt care-seeking
Clinician
- AI diagnostic tools - analytics layer
	- pattern recognition of health conditions, trained and validated against established clinical standards or diagnostic frameworks
	- validated and regulated technologies qualify as digital health diagnostic technologies
	- Provide decision-support, not autonomous diagnosis
- Dashboard - visualisation layer
- EHR integration - context layer


##### Digital Health: (3) Prediction
Prediction uses collected and diagnostic data to predict deterioration, complications, or health risks
Patient
- mobile apps or wearables provide risk alerts
- validated and regulated technologies qualify as digital health predictive technologies
- Support self-awareness, preventive behaviour change
Clinicians
AI tools - predictive
Dashboards - visualisation
EHR integration - context


##### Digital Health: (4) Interventions

Interventions support patients through actionable steps to manage current conditions or
prevent future complications. based on diagnosis, or predicted risks

Patient
- digital therapeutics (DTx) - evidence-based, regulated apps deliver formal treatment 
- Wellness apps - unregulated, provide support but not formal treatment
- Following diagnosis
	- implement treatment plans (DTx)
	- support medication adherence and behaviour change
- Following prediction
	- Deliver preventive therapy (DTx)
	- support behaviour change to reduce risks
Clinician
-  Following diagnosis: adjust therapy or treatment plans
-  Following Predictions: prioritise high risk patients, adjust preventive interventions, monitor outcomes

### Main health outcomes


Aim is to improve health outcomes - disease state / overall health
Resulting from interventions supported by captured data, and tailored to the patient's diagnosis, or predicted risks

Digital health technologies are evaluated against three broad categories of outcomes
- body system-level or clinical outcomes
- behavioural or functional outcomes
- long-term outcomes

#### Health outcomes: types

- body system-level outcomes
	- cardio vascular & metabolic
		- heart conditions / hypertension: - improved heart rate - better blood pressure
		- respiratory asthma, respiratory infections: - improved breathing - oxygen saturation
		- metabolic: diabetes, obesity: - improved blood glucose - better insulin sensitivity
	- neurological - brain, spinal cord, nerves
		- stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's, dementia: improved brain activity, early stroke detection, effective seizure detection, improved cognitive function
		- anxiety, depression, sleep: better stress regulation, effective monitoring of sweat, improved heart rate variability
	- musculoskeletal, renal, digestive, immune -
		- arthritis, back pain, mobility limitations - improved balance - improved functional independence 
		- chronic kidney disease - improved kidney function
		- digestive disorders  - improved diet adherence 
		- autoimmune disease - improved inflammatory marker profiles

- behavioural / functional outcomes
	- medication adherence 
	- lifestyle behaviours
	- functional independence 
	- cognitive engagement 

	- environmental context - air and water quality, noise, neighbourhood safety
- long-term outcomes
	- short-term: medication reminders, guided therapy
	- long-term: continuous digital therapeutics (DTx), lifestyle coaching, wellness apps - reduced long-term hospitalisations, complications, and improved quality of life

### Data source and modality


**clinicians, hospitals & labs**

**patients apps & wearable devices**

**integrated platforms**

#### Modalities of Digital Health Data

**text**
- symptoms reports, clinical notes, medication logs
**images**
- scans, mammograms, ultrasounds, x-rays
- visualise structures and pathology
**biosignal time-series**
ECG, EEG, heart rate, HRV, resp rate, blood glucose
