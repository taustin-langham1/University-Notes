**Ethics Cont.**

Four principles of Biomedical Ethics

- **Autonomy:** Respect patient choice and control i.e., consent on sharing app data
- **Benefice:** Promote well-being i.e., improved health outcomes
- **Non-maleficence:** Do no harm, i.e., anticipating and reducing harm at all costs
- **Justice:** Ensure fairness and equity, i.e., the benefits of digital health should be for everyone

so, ethics in digital health: 
- biases in digital health data and design can shape **who benefits** and **who is left behind**
- ethical principles guide responsible evaluation and decision-making 
- ethics ensures digital health technologies are safe, fair and accountable
- evaluation isn't just about numbers - its about impact on people


## Experiments for evaluation of digital health technologies

- planning and evaluation
- experimental study
	- variables
	- groups
	- randomisation
	- hypotheses
	- participants, sampling
	- data analysis

- understand key concepts of experimental study
- knowledge and skills of planning experimental study
- knowledge and skills of hypotheses testing for health data analysis


### Planning evaluation

#### Clinical effectiveness

- different research methods tell us different things
	- surveys
	- interviews,focus groups
	- observations
	- **experiments** - how using technology *impacts* and changes *outcmes*
		- the gold standard
### Experimental study
- structured research method, explore cause-and-effect
- manipulates one variable and measures its impact on another variable
#### Variables

Independent Variable (IV): **Cause** to explore
the cause whose impact we want to explore

example:
	- any digital health technology
	- age, gender, income, digital literacy level

Dependent Variable (DV): **Effect** we measure
the outcome we measure to assess impact

example:
- clinical outcome
- behavioural outcome
- digital outcome


## Experimental Study: 
### Variables

how many measurements of DV we need to explore cause-effect

at least two points:
	before intervention
	post intervention
		immediate measurement
		additional measurement 
challenge
	measurements before and after do not fully rule out other causes

### experimental groups

before intervention (T1) and post intervention measurements (T2)
- shows change over time
- but can't tell if the change is caused by the intervention
	- age gender digital literacy other medical condiditons
- this is out experimental group

#### Random allocation to groups

- random assignment of participants to the two groups
	- minimises selection bias


#### within- and between-groups

**within-group**
- looks at change over time inside a single group
- compares pre- and post- intervention measurements
- shows whether outcomes improved, worsened, or stayed stable
- useful for: seeing effect in each group individually

**between groups**
- compares change between groups
- test whether improvement is greater in one group
- strengthens casual inference by filtering out background trends
- useful for: identifying true intervention effect

Why do they matter?
Determines the right statistical test
• Within-group: repeated measurements on the same participants, i.e., paired tests
• Between-group: different participants in each group, i.e., independent tests
Affects statistical power, i.e., the probability of detecting a true effect if it actually exists
• Within-group designs usually have more power to detect change
• Between-group designs require larger samples but give stronger causal evidence
Influences interpretation
• Within-group change shows improvement
• Between-group difference shows attributable effect
• Combining both gives a fuller picture of intervention impact

### Hypotheses

- a testable statement that predicts the relationship between the IV and DV
- expected change and how its linked to the intervention, so what we expect to happen

#### Types:

**primary hypothesis** - the main claim the study is designed to test
- usually linked to the primary clinical outcome
- drives sample size calculation, main analysis, and interpretation
Secondary hypotheses - 
 - usually linked to behavioural outcomes
 - ad depth and context but are not the main test of effectiveness
Exploratory hypotheses - (sometimes secondary)
- usually linked to digital outcomes
- additional, often more flexible questions, i.e., engagement pattern

#### Selecting Hypotheses

- always the primary hypothesis

Optional: select secondary or exploratory hypotheses
mind the trade-offs, as more hypotheses
- increase risk of Type 1 error (false positives) unless adjustments are made
- more complex analysis
- more difficult interpretation


### Participants, sampling

**participants**
identifying participants and recruitment channels
sampling:logic of sampling and generalisation

the logic of sampling:

sample - a subset of individuals selected from a larger group
population - the larger group to whom we want to generalise the study findings


why sampling matters

- we cannot study the entire population, so we select a representative subset
- representativeness ensures that the key characteristics of the sample match those of the population
- inferential statistics: estimate how study findings may be generalisable to population

### Data analysis
- descriptive statistics: describe the sample
- inferential statistics: infer how sample findings generalise to the population

choice of statistical tests depend on
- level of measurement of DV
	- how data are classified and structured
	- four levels in increasing information content:
		- nominal - no order
			- labels or groupings only
			- descriptive statistics - frequencies
			- inferential statistics - chi square
		- ordinal - with order
			- categories with rank order
			- rank matters
		- interval - numeric, equal intervals, no true zero
			- differences are meaningful, but ratios are no: 20 C is not "twice as hot" as 10 C
			- descriptive statistics: all
		- ratio - numeric, equal intervals, true zero
			- ratios are meaningful, zero means none
			- descriptive statistics: all
- paired or independent data
- number of groups
- study hypotheses i.e. testing differences, associations, or predictions
		comparing two groups
		- tests whether there is a significant difference between two means
			- good for sample designs with one IV (two labels)
			- assumptions - approximately normal distribution and similar variances between groups
			- produces a p-value
