1. Explain the importance of taking a risk-informed approach to defining a security architecture for networked systems
2. Summarise the main concepts that are associated with designing a defence in depth architecture for networked systems


cyber security architecture

- security requirements
- security design
- security controls or measures

an architecture should consider people, process and technology to be effective

it is important to take a risk-informed approach to defining a security architecture, to best apply limited resources

Defence in depth - castle metaphor

Graded approach
- applying resources proportionately to the potential impact or consequence, focusing resources where they have the greatest benefit
- advantages:
	- Resources are limited
	- simpler implementation
	- apply greatest protections to most significant functions
- The use of security levels delivers a graded approach
