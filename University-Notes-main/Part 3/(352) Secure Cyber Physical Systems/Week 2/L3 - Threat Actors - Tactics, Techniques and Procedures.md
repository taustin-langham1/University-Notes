- Examples of some attacks on cyber physical systems

- Tactics, techniques and procedures of CPS threat actors

- Threat actor dimensions, motivations and opportunity

- Stuxnet case study



## Successful Cyber-Attacks


1. a target must have discoverable vulnerabilities or weaknesses in systems and processes
2. threat actor must have sufficient resources to use the vulnerabilities and exploit the system
3. threat actor must believe they will benefit by performing the attacks

4. is the threat actor able to interact with the CPS

## Threat Actor Characterisation 

Capabilities 
- ability and tools of adversary to successfully achieve intent - their tactics techniques and procedures
motivation and intent
- reason and goal the adversary seeks to achieve; financial vs. ideological or theft vs sabotage
opportunity
- knowledge of vulnerabilities and the threat actor's ability to leverage and exploit them to breach the system

# Tactics, Techniques and Procedures


> "The behaviour of an actor. A tactic is the highest-level description of this behaviour, while techniques give a more detailed description of behaviour in the context of a tactic, and procedures an even lower level, highly detailed description in the context of a technique"

tactic - achieve, have and need to do
technique - ways to achieve these tactics
procedure - specific ways to realise the technique


## Threat actor opportunity


Opportunities are made in CPS similarly to traditional IT systems
- social engineering
- insider threat
- software deployed with known/unknown vulnerabilities
- compromised hardware or software supply chain

## opportunity may be harder


some opportunities may need the actor to be physically present near equipment in order to attack it
may need specific equipment or bespoke software to attack uncommon hardware/software problems



## Suxnet - what made it successful

1. Discover-able vulnerabilities or weaknesses in systems and processes
	1. Unkown vulnerabilities that were exploited
2. Sufficient resources
	1. able to develop and deliver the worm
3. Benefit by performing the attack
	1. impacted the target's physical assets
4. Is the threat actor able to interact with the CPS
	1. Able to bridge an air gap to an enterprise through which an OT system was accessed

## fin:
• Threat actors have diverse TTPs to compromise CPSs
• TTPs for IT systems and CPSs differ
• But often it is useful to compromise IT systems to impact CPSs
• Variety of online frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, MITRE CAPEC)
• But other dimensions of threat actors are important
