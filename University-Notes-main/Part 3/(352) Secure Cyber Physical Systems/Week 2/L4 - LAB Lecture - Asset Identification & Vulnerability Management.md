- types of assets that are specific to cyber-physical systems, especially industrial control systems

- approaches to identifying assets for industrial control systems

- Strategies for managing vulnerabilities in identified assets for industrial control systems and how they differ from those applied in enterprise settings

## Industrial Control System Assets

**asset types**
- hardware
- personnel
- software
- tech
- auxiliary equipment
- facilities
- network
- information

**industrial control system asset types**
- Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)
	- PLCs are the brains
	- programmable using graphic or textual languages
	- **runs in cycles:**
		- **read inputs (Sensors)->Calculate output(Control)->Write Outputs(Actuators)**
	- hardened for 24/7 operation in industrial environments
	- modular architecture

- Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) &
- SCADA Systems (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)
	• HMIs can be implemented in mobile devices, touch panels and
	workstations, as part of SCADA systems
	• Interactive screens that display the state of the physical process and
	allow the operator to manually interact (within certain limits)
	• Some Features:
	• Graphical displays
	• Command inputs
	• Trend plots
	• Alarms
	• Reports

- Data Historians
- Remote Terminal Units (RTUs)
- Sensors and Actuators
- Distributed Control Systems
- Industrial Network Infrastructure


## The Purdue Model

## IT vs OT Comparison

![[Pasted image 20251016123859.png]]


*IT and OT are in the process of converging - systems adopting IT tech and standards
benefits are more powerful systems, lower cost and maintenance*

## Vulnerability Management vs Patch Management

**vulnerability management**
- keep track of known vulnerabilities in an environment 
- resolve or mitigate these vulnerabilities
**patch management**
- keeps track of software versions and patch levels
- push patches remotely to keep systems up-to-date
	- assumption: patches available
- manage all the devices that need patches

- patch: firmware updates / general updates - not always possible -> safety?availability?

patch or no patch?
