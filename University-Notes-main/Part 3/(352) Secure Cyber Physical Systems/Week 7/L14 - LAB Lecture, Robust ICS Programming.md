### IEC 61131 Unified PLC Programming Standard

1. Ladder Logic
	1. allows the programming of complex relay logic circuits
2. Sequential Flow Charts
	1. allows programming of a PLC using flowcharts
3. Function Block Diagrams (FBDs)
	1. can be used to simplify the programming of closed-feedback loops, as they mostly work from inputs and outputs
4. Instruction list
	1. not widely used, easy for infinite loops and computational errors
5. Structured Text
	1. a text-based programming language who's syntax is drawn heavily from PASCAL and Ada
