#### Notes:

second ever leet code problem!
 
in increasing order by height
however many students are in the wrong spot?
so [1,1,4,2,1,3]
in increasing order
index 2, index 4 and index 5 do not match

oh! 

maybe, sort the list first. get the sorted list
compare the sorted list to the input array
heights: [1,1,4,2,1,3]
expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
if heights[i] != expected[i] then cntr++?

### Solution:

```
public static int heightChecker(int[] heights){
	int[] expected = Arrays.copyOf(heights, heights.length);
	int unexpected = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < expected.length; i++){
		for (int j = 0; j < expected.length - 1 - i; j++){
			if(expected[j] > expected[j + 1]){
				int temp = expected[j];
				expected[j] = expected[j + 1];
				expected[j + 1] = temp;
			}
		}
	}
		for(int k = 0; k < heights.length; k++){

			if (expected[k] != heights[k]){

					unexpected ++;
			}
		}
		return unexpected;
}
```

### Problems Encountered:

Just copying the heights array into the expected array for sorting.

### Take aways:

#### # 1
I'm ready for something a bit more difficult!
