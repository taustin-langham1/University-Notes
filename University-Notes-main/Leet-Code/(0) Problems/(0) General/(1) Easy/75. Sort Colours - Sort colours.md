#### Notes:

**My first leet code problem**, I came across as the fist problem in one of its introductory courses. Both this course and the Intro to Algorithms book I read explored selection sort, which is what i chose for the sort colours problem.

I chose selection sort here, as it was both the most recent algorithm I'd come across, and I read that it was actually O(N^2/2), but as big O ignores constants, its still deemed O(N^2)

### solution:

```
import java.util.Arrays;

class Sorting{

public static void main(String []args){

int[] unsortedColours = {2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2 , 2, 1, 1 ,0};

System.out.println("inputArray" + Arrays.toString(unsortedColours));

int[] sortedArray = sortColours(unsortedColours);

System.out.println("sortedArray" + Arrays.toString(unsortedColours));

}

  
  
  

public static int[] sortColours(int[] nums){

int lowestValueIndex;

for (int i = 0; i < inputArray.length; i++){

    lowestValueIndex = i;  

    for(int j = i + 1; j < inputArray.length; j++){

        if (inputArray[j] < inputArray[lowestValueIndex]){

            lowestValueIndex = j;  

    }  

    }

  

    int temp = inputArray[lowestValueIndex];

    inputArray[lowestValueIndex] = inputArray[i];

    inputArray[i] = temp;  

}

  

return nums;

}

}

```


### Problems Encountered:

At first, I just wrote the standard selection sort code, but it ran with a very strange jumbled output, after a little investigation it just turned out that I hadn't actually made it so J would update with I, basically meaning it would just compare itself to itself, and as the list had duplicates, I guess that's why it jumbled strangely.

### Take aways:

#### # 1
The main take away would be the swapping code. I've now seen it twice, in bubble and selection sort:

```
int temp = arr[i]
// temp holds index i's value
arr[i] = arr[j]
// value at index i now becomes value at index j
arr[j] = temp
// value at j now becomes what i used to be  
```

I think its cool that I could've come up with this myself (even my brain which takes every ounce of my humanity to push away from the easy path), and its still deemed a cool way to do it. 

#### # 2

also the i <- j comparison came up twice, though selection sorts does seem more reasonable
