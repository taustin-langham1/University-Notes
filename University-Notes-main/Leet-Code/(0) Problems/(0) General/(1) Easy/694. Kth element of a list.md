for this one I went with two approaches, one with sorting the list, and the other without sorting

in each i decided against using python inbuilt helper functions, as i guess theyd have just been onliners with little learned along the way

``` python
  
    def findKthLargestAfterSorting(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
 
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(len(nums) - i - 1):
                if(nums[j] > nums[j + 1]):
                    nums[j], nums[j + 1] = nums[j + 1], nums[j]
                    
        unique = []
        for num in nums:
            if not unique or unique[ -1] != num:
                unique.append(num)
        return unique[- k]

```

i chose bubble sort here as i'm still not completely confident on my ability to understand insertion sort, i mean i get it but the code never makes any sense to me

the set-ification thing ive got going on only works with a sorted list as youd imagine

without sorting:
