digital mammography is one of a few imaging methods - followed by breast tomosynthesis, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound imaging modalities.

a major issue in breast tissue imaging is the overlapping of tissue that hides breast information

**in-situ** and **invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)**

in-situ is less common (20-30% of cases)

### Screen-film mammography

issues

once the film is produces further improvements cannot be carried out for images with lesser contrast 
trouble detecting suspicious lesions in breasts with dense glandular tissue
SFM is not digital


### Digital mammography

High rate of false positives 

lack specificity in - younger women with denser breast tissue, or situations where imaging artifacts or overlapping structures mimic suspicious findings


# Digital Mammography

difficulties due to: variability in appearance abnormalities and hiding abnormal tissues in dense breasts

**Dense breasts MIMIC abnormalities**

1. Overlap and structural complexity - dense fibro glandular tissue appears white on a mammogram - just like cancer tissues

the main issues are dense breasts - not just its proportion but the actual total volume of dense tissue - strongly correlates with more false-positive marks. Radiologists and algorithms alike struggle more as fibro glandular volume increases
