Perceptual processor / cognitive processor / motor processor


Perceptual processor = 100ms cycle time
Cognitive processor = 70ms cycle time - recognize, act 
Motor procesor = 70ms cycle time - time required to issue motor command


MHP model human processor - humans can be viewed as information processors

- Perception
	- we gain information from the world through sensors

- Cognition
	- We process information based on existing knowledge
	- we gain new knowledge, and make decisions

- motor actions
	- we have information output into the world
	- speaking, gesturing, writing, drawing, navigating the world, manipulating

#### Questions

1.  if 20 clicks ps are played for 5 seconds, about how many clicks could a person actually hear?

-  **cycle time of a humans perception is 100ms, 1000ms in 1 second, so 10 cycles every 1 second.**
- **so if its 20 clicks per second for 5 seconds, only around 50 clicks would be heard?**

- this answer is correct

1. If 30 clicks per second are played for 5 seconds, about how many clicks could a person hear?

- **same? 50?, if theres a limit, increasing the external input of clicks wont just improve the internal limit**

- also correct, the difference is that the sound would be more intense (3 clicks become fused into a single one)

1. How many frames per second must a video be played to give illusion of motion?

- **10? as thats how many cycles are - at maximum, possible. the 'Perceptual processor' is for both visual and auditory stores.**

- this answer is correct

1. In a talking head video, how far off can the audio and video be before a person perceives the video as unsynchronized

- **idk man whats a talking head video? oh like someone speaking**

- **Possible answer: 10 / 80 / 160** 

- **answer was 80, because 'studies show'**



Lecture Revision Questions:

is there any parallel processing in the human perceptual system?


**there is no parallel processing, as all the processing is done in the working memory, not working and long term memroy**

What is the input to the perceptual processor and what is the output, and where is it stored?

**the input to the perceptual processor would be eyes and ears, and its stored in the working memory**


Identify the processors in the MHP model and their cycle times

**1 - perceptual processor  - visual and auditory - 100ms**
**2- motor processor 70ms** 
**3- cognitive processor 70 ms**

Think of a simple computer game you know and consider three ways in which it could be made harder: one that increases perception time, one that increases cognitive processing, and one that increases time to act

- **tetris**
- **perception time - add two blocks that fall at the same time rather than one, more objects to keep perception of and to analyse**

- **add more shapes to the pool of possible tetris shapes, so that every time a random block is sent out for the tetris, you have to discern it more carefully from the other blocks**
