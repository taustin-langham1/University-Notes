• Application of Fitts’ Law

• Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)

• Describe performance models for different types of input task

• Choose the right model and interpret its parameters correctly for modelling and prediction of task completion time

• Identify movement tasks in user interfaces that are difficult and consider how they can be made easier





**AIMED MOVEMENTS:**




**MOVEMENT TIME = a + b * log2(D/W + 1)**

a IS A TIME CONSTANT IN SECONDS, b RATE AT WHICH TIME INCREASES WITH TASK DIFFICULTY, IN SECONDS/BIT

a = 50ms b = 100ms/bit

log2(6/2.83+1)

**INDEX OF DIFFICULTY =log2(D/W + 1)**

DISTANCE (D), WIDTH (W)


**THROUGHPUT = INDEX OF DIFFICULTY / MOVEMENT TIME**

**IN BITS PER SECOND**

the amount of data that can pass through us in a given amount of time, based on the movement time and how difficult it is... i think

1/16 = 4bit/selection
1/128=7bit/selection
