MULTI STORE

![[Pasted image 20250522193721.png]]

sensory input, ram like working memory, lonh-term memory like SSD

working memory isnt considered to be a store


**QUESTIONS**
Compare and contrast the three models of memory and their components, what
are the limitations of these models?

sensory memory, working memory, long term memory

1) spatial
		- approximate locations
		- variable
		- can improve
		- define spatial relationships between users


2) working
		- directly related to attention. selected focus, foreground of awareness
		- volatile (20-30s (usually around 10))
		- 
3) long term
		- Explicit vs implicit long term memory

What user interface problems are related to the limitations of working memory?


its a very volatile form of memory - only around 10 seconds worth of awareness. this may make it difficult to maintain attention, if the user interface doesn't update the users attention in some way during that time, it may be lost, and along with it any concurrency they may have had in their understanding of the system 



How can interactive systems support the retrieval of information from memory?

the interactive systems may help the user to relate to an experience they have had before, allowing the user to draw on common experiences, and relate the actual model to their mental model
