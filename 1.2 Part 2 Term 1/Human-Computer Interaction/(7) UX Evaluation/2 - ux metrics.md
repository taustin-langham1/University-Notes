USABILITY

USER EXPERIENCE (UX)

HOW DO USERS **PERFORM WITH THE SYTEM, AND HOW DO THEY FEEL ABOUT IT**

actual experience



• Learnability: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first
time they encounter the design?
• Efficiency: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they
perform tasks?
• Memorability: When users return to the design after a period of not
using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?
• Errors: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors,
and how easily can they recover from the errors?
• Satisfaction: How pleasant is it to use the design?
