- Recognize the significance of HCI for the development of systems that people can use successfully, efficiently and safely
	- *Related topics:*
	- Human Perception, Memory


- employ knowledge of human abilities and behavior to **analyze user interface problems and motivate user interface designs**
	- *Related topics:*
	-  Fitts law, KLM, Gulfs


- HCI principles and guidelines in the design and implementation of interactive systems
	- *Related topics:*
	- UC-D, Personas, Prototyping


- evaluate usability and UX of interactive systems, using appropriate methods and metrics
	- *Related topics:*
	-  User Studies, usability, eye tracking




Topics:

Based behavior:

Pilot completing the A320 Memory Item Checklist → Rules-based Behavior,

memory is apparently rules based?

User navigating an unfamiliar Booking Website → Knowledge-based Behavior


and navigation of something unfamiliar is apparently knowledge based

##### Understanding of Humans

MHP (Model human processor)
- perceptual processor (visual store and auditory, 100ms cycle time)
- Cognitive processor (Long term and working memory, 70ms)
- Motor processor (working memory / arms, wrists, fingers, etc. 70ms)

Gestalt (perception of patterns, shapes, and structure)

##### Understanding of Interactions

Fitts's Law (model of human performance)
- when the target is nearer, we can reach it faster
- when the target is larger, we can land on it quicker
Index of difficulty(log2(D/W+1))

KLM (keystroke-level model)
- predict how long it takes an expert user to complete a routine on a task without errors
- ![[Pasted image 20250507131401.png]]

Gulfs 
- Gap of **EXECUTION**, before interacting - Interaction - based on mental model
- Gap of **EVALUATION,** after interacting - Feedback - based on reality of the application
Mappings (relationship between a control and its effect in the world)
- Designers aim to communicate the conceptual model through the design of the user interface
#####  How to Design/Evaluate interfaces
