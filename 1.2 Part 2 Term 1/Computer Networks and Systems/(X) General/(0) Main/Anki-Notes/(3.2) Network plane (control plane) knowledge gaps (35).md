control plane - network routing protocols etc

network wide logic

servers implement SDN



###### link-state?

complete topology, understand the state of all link costs



###### distance vector?

**decentralized:** iterative process of computation, exchange of info with neighbors. routers initially know link costs attached to neighbors 

- distributed, self-stopping
- iterative, asynchronous


## intra vs inter AS domain routing ?


**INTRA**

- within single AS
- Link state usually (OSPF) Dijkstra's: distance vector, hop count, limited scale - authenticated.
	- two level hierarchy
		- local area + backbone forward packets via border routers
- RIP (Routing information protocol)
- EIGRP: enhanced interior 


'hot potato' routing. choose local intra-domain gateway that has least cost / / even if there is a path with a lower inter domain cost



**INTER**

- between AS 
- BGP - path-vector, uses AS-path for loop prevention. **Allows subnets to advertise its existence, and the destinations it can reach, to rest of internet**

**decentralized:** an iterative process of computation, exchange of info with neighbors. routers initially only know link costs to attached neighbors


eBGP and iBGP - 

e - connects routers from different autonomous systems

i - connects routes from the same autonomous systems

communicated over a semi-permanent TCP connection, remember bgp is a path vector protocol

• **OPEN**: opens TCP connection to remote BGP peer and authenticates  
sending BGP peer  
• **UPDATE**: advertises new path (or withdraws old)  
• **KEEPALIVE**: keeps connection alive in absence of **UPDATES**; also **ACKs**  
**OPEN** request  
• **NOTIFICATION**: reports errors in previous msg; also used to close  
**connection**
