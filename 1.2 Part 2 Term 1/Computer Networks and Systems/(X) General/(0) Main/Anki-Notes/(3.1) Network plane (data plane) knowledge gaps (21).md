IP


network, link, physical layers present in all internet devices - not just edge networks

Service:
deliver packets across the network


Interface:
Send a packet to a specific destination


Protocol:
Define globally unique address // maintain routing tables


Transfers transport layer segment from one host to another, using link layer services. netowork encapsulates transport layer header to create a network layer datagram


if switch fabric within the router is slower than input ports combined -> queueing may occur at input queues. queueing delay and loss due to input buffer overflow


datagrams arrive from fabric faster than link transmission rate
