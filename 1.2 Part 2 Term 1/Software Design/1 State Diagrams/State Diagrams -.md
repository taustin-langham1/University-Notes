'state' machines, or diagrams model dynamic behavior

**State concepts**

**State**: condition object stays in for some time - behaves same way during this time
**Transition**: From *state*
**Trigger:** Trigger the *transition* of *state*

**Guard:** condition to be met to cause a *trigger* for the *transition*
**Event:** an action that occurs as a result of the *transition*
